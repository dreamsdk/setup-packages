# Setup Packages for DreamSDK #

This repository contains all the precompiled packages included in [DreamSDK
Setup](https://www.dreamsdk.org/ "DreamSDK").

Whenever a new package is added to this repository, it is made available on the
[public distribution site](https://sizious.emunova.net/dreamsdk/packages/), 
accessible via the `prepare` script included in
[the main repository](https://github.com/dreamsdk/dreamsdk).

Therefore, you don't need to clone or use this repository: it is not part of the
workflow for creating new DreamSDK packages. If you do decide to clone it, do so
sparingly, as it uses Git LFS and has many restrictions; access could quickly be
blocked if too many people try to clone this repository.

The distribution site is hosted by [EmuNova](https://emunova.net/), made by
[Thomas Parisot](https://thom4.net/).
